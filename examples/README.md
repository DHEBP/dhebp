# TELA Examples and Tools

This directory contains practical examples, implementation references, and debugging tools for TELA development.

## Directory Structure

### `/tools`
Interactive debugging and testing tools:
- `xswd-debug-tool.html` - XSWD API debugging interface for testing DERO/TELA API calls

### `/templates`
Ready-to-use code templates and implementations:

## Usage

These files are provided as reference implementations and practical tools. They are not part of the core documentation but serve as:

1. **Working examples** - Demonstrate how to implement TELA features
2. **Debugging tools** - Help troubleshoot TELA applications
3. **Templates** - Starting points for your own implementations

## Note

For documentation about these tools and their usage, please refer to the main documentation site. These files contain actual implementations rather than documentation.
