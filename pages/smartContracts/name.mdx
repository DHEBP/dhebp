## Nameservice
Register and associate a DERO wallet with a username using the Nameservice. It includes instructions for checking the availability of a username and the process to register it with the associated DERO wallet using specific cURL commands. Additionally, it provides notes for replacing the placeholder username and the reserved scid for nameservice registration.

### Step 1
Check whether the username is already registered. You cannot register the username if it's already taken.

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:40402/json_rpc -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"0","method":"nametoaddress","params":{"name":"TESTUSERNAME" }}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

### Step 2
Register and associate a DERO wallet with the username.

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:40403/json_rpc -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"0","method":"scinvoke","params":{"scid":"0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001","ringsize":2, "sc_rpc":[{"name":"entrypoint","datatype":"S","value":"Register"}, {"name":"name","datatype":"S","value":"TESTUSERNAME" }] }}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

**Note:**

- Replace "TESTUSERNAME" with your desired available username in the above steps.
- `"scid":"0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001"` is reserved for nameservice registration.
