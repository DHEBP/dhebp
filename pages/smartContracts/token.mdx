# Token Smart Contract Guide

Dero Stargate DVM Smart Contracts guide to install and test various functions of the private token Smart Contract.

### Notes:
1. All wallet addresses need to be registered first with SC before interacting with it. This condition will be removed in the future.
2. The requirement of `detoAnyRandomAddressFromExplorer` during SC invocation will be removed in the future.
3. Burn is equal to deposit if SCID is defined, else DERO/token will disappear/burn from the network forever. Burn will be renamed to something more meaningful. This can be proved with cryptographic proof.

### Instructions:

1. Download DERO Stargate testnet source and binaries from [GitHub](https://github.com/deroproject/derohe/releases).

2. Start Dero daemon in testnet mode:

```shell
./derod-linux-amd64 --testnet;
```

3. Start Dero wallet in testnet:

```shell
dero-wallet-cli-linux-amd64 --rpc-server --wallet-file testnet.wallet --testnet;
```

4. Start a second instance of Dero wallet to test transfer/ownership functions, etc.:

```shell
dero-wallet-cli-linux-amd64 --wallet-file testnet2.wallet --testnet --rpc-server --rpc-bind=127.0.0.1:40403;
```

5. Dero testnet Explorer: [Testnet Explorer](https://testnetexplorer.dero.io/)

### Commands:

To send DERO to multiple users in one transaction:

```shell
curl http://127.0.0.1:40403/json_rpc -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"0","method":"transfer","params":{"transfers":[{"amount":100000,"destination":"deto1ADDRESS1"},{"amount":300000,"destination":"deto1ADDRESS12"}]}}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json';
```

DERO has two types of SCs: public and private.

1. Public SCs are public with all data/code/exchanges available to the public.
2. Private SCs have their smart contract data public, but no one knows the specific details of users' token ownership or transactions. It's like cash in a bank; once it's withdrawn, the bank doesnâ€™t know who has what amount or how it's used/sent/received.

### Installing Private Smart Contract:

Download `token.bas` [here](https://git.dero.io/DeroProject/derosuite_stargate/src/master/cmd/dvm/token.bas).

```shell
curl --request POST --data-binary @token.bas http://127.0.0.1:40403/install_sc;
```

To check private token balance in the wallet:

```shell
balance SCID;
```

Download SC code, check SC balance, and variables from the chain:

```shell
curl http://127.0.0.1:40402/json_rpc -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"0","method":"getsc","params":{"scid":"aacaa7bb2388d06e523e5bc0783e4e131738270641406c12978155ba033373af", "code":true}}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json';
```

### Examples of Various Functions:

- Send private tokens from one wallet to another wallet:

```shell
curl http://127.0.0.1:40403/json_rpc -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"0","method":"transfer","params":{"transfers":[{"amount":111111,"destination":"deto1qxqqen6lqmksmzmxmfqmxp2y8zvkldtcq8jhkzqflmyczepjw9dp46gc3cczu"},{"amount":333333,"destination":"deto1qxqqen6lqmksmzmxmfqmxp2y8zvkldtcq8jhkzqflmyczepjw9dp46gc3cczu","scid": "aacaa7bb2388d06e523e5bc0783e4e131738270641406c12978155ba033373af"}]}}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json';
```

- Convert DERO to tokens 1:1 swap:

```shell
curl http://127.0.0.1:40403/json_rpc -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"0","method":"transfer","params":{"transfers":[{"amount":1,"destination":"deto1qxqqen6lqmksmzmxmfqmxp2y8zvkldtcq8jhkzqflmyczepjw9dp46gc3cczu", "burn":44}],"scid":"aacaa7bb2388d06e523e5bc0783e4e131738270641406c12978155ba033373af", "sc_rpc":[{"name":"entrypoint","datatype":"S","value":"IssueTOKENX"}]}}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json';
```

- Convert tokens to DERO 1:1 swap:

```shell
curl http://127.0.0.1:40403/json_rpc -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"0","method":"transfer","params":{"transfers":[{"scid":"aacaa7bb2388d06e523e5bc0783e4e131738270641406c12978155ba033373af", "amount":1,"destination":"deto1qxqqen6lqmksmzmxmfqmxp2y8zvkldtcq8jhkzqflmyczepjw9dp46gc3cczu", "burn":9}],"scid":"aacaa7bb2388d06e523e5bc0783e4e131738270641406c12978155ba033373af", "sc_rpc":[{"name":"entrypoint","datatype":"S","value":"ConvertTOKENX"}]}}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json';
```

- Withdraw balance only for the smart contract owner:

```shell
curl http://127.0.0.1:40403/json_rpc -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"0","method":"transfer","params":{"transfers":[{"amount":111111,"destination":"deto1qxqqen6lqmksmzmxmfqmxp2y8zvkldtcq8jhkzqflmyczepjw9dp46gc3cczu"}],"scid":"aacaa7bb2388d06e523e5bc0783e4e131738270641406c12978155ba033373af", "sc_rpc":[{"name":"entrypoint","datatype":"S","value":"Withdraw"}, {"name":"amount","datatype":"U","value":2}]}}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json';
```

- Transfer ownership of the smart contract to a new address/owner:

```shell
curl http://127.0.0.1:40403/json_rpc -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"0","method":"transfer","params":{"transfers":[{"

```

- Claim ownership of the smart contract:

```shell
curl http://127.0.0.1:40403/json_rpc -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"0","method":"transfer","params":{"transfers":[{"amount":111111,"destination":"deto1qxqqen6lqmksmzmxmfqmxp2y8zvkldtcq8jhkzqflmyczepjw9dp46gc3cczu"}],"scid":"aacaa7bb2388d06e523e5bc0783e4e131738270641406c12978155ba033373af", "sc_rpc":[{"name":"entrypoint","datatype":"S","value":"ClaimOwnership"}]}}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json';
```

```

DERO Smart Contracts Tokens privacy can be understood just like banks handle cash. Once cash is out from the bank, the bank is not aware of it (who owns what value) until it is deposited back. The smart contract only maintains supply and other necessary items to keep it working. DERO Tokens can be transferred to other wallets just like native DERO with Homomorphic Encryption and without involvement of issuing Smart Contracts. Token issuing Smart Contract cannot hold/freeze/control their tokens once they are issued and sent to any wallet. This token is Private. Use `Function InitializePrivate() Uint64` to make any Smart Contract private.
