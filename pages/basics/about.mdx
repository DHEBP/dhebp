## Mission
The goal is to create a unique state of the art blockchain technology with enhanced reliability, privacy, security, usability, and portability by bringing together some of the best proven technologies. These technologies will allow for the creation and execution of decentralized applications on a secure private blockchain.

## Dero Foundation
The DERO Foundation aims to provide support for the advancement of the DERO Platform and supporting the DERO Community to integrate decentralized privacy systems and standards within the blockchain ecosystem. This will help with the creation and deployment of private decentralized applications, payment systems, services and tools.

## To Our Community
From the trolls to the most stalwart, from the moderators to the developers, we thank you for joining us on this journey and for your continued support. It has been quite an adventure and there are many more to come. Continue to spread the word so that we may attract like-minded individuals that will build by the people, for the people. Letâ€™s bring DERO to the masses.
