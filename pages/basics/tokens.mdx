In cryptocurrency, a token is a user-created asset on the blockchain, created with the use of Smart Contracts. Tokens can take many forms, be it Non-fungible tokens, or fungible coin-like tokens. Since tokens can be fully fungible, they can act as completely separate speculative assets on the blockchain, and can be used for commerce like the base cryptocurrency can.

## Dero Tokens
Dero is special in that tokens from private smart contracts are natively stored in ones wallet, rather than all in the smart contract, meaning they are immune to rugpulls that are common with ERC-20 tokens, and benefit from all the anonymity that the main Dero coin itself also has. Of course, public, ETH-like tokens are also possible on the Dero network.
