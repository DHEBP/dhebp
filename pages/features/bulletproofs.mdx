# What are Bulletproofs?
![Rocket Bulletproofs](/assets/bulletproofs.jpeg)

Bulletproofs serve as cryptographic tools that offer a way to verify the existence of information without revealing the actual content. For instance, they can ascertain that a number falls within a certain range while keeping the specifics of that number private. Unlike zk-SNARKs, which demand a trusted setup, Bulletproofs enable trustless verification, enhancing privacy within transactions.

The primary function of Bulletproofs extends beyond enabling confidential transactions; they also significantly reduce the size of verification proofs, often condensing them to around 10% of their original size. This reduction not only ensures smaller transactions but also reinforces privacy measures.

## DERO Rocket Bulletproofs

Introduced in June 2018, DERO made a pioneering move by deploying Rocket Bulletproofs on its mainnet, marking a significant milestone as the inaugural cryptocurrency to adopt this advancement. It's noteworthy that DERO's Bulletproofs were crafted from the ground up and were not borrowed or adapted from any existing public implementations. As a result, they sidestepped vulnerabilities detected in Monero's bulletproof audit, as DERO's implementation differs cryptographically. One standout advantage of this divergence from Monero's approach is their remarkable speed, which is approximately **10X** faster than Monero's Bulletproofs.

DERO's Rocket Bulletproofs were exclusively tailored for DERO, showcasing unique code and dedicated development efforts. These bulletproofs are celebrated for their swiftness, robust security, and scalability, setting a precedent for cryptographic innovation within the DERO ecosystem.
