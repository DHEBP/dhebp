# DERO Homomorphic Encryption
![Homomorphic Encryption](/assets/derohe.jpeg)

Homomorphic encryption, a revolutionary technology in data security, allows calculations on encrypted data while maintaining privacy. It's essential for secure cloud computing, regulatory compliance, and fostering secure data collaboration, ensuring privacy and bolstered security.

DERO combines homomorphic encryption with an account-based model, ensuring instantaneous transactions, robust security, and privacy. Through Σ mining and Σ blocks, a network-wide consensus is employed, enabling instant transaction confirmations within the same block and rewarding all miners.

What distinguishes DERO is its encrypted blockchain and account-based model, providing genuine on-chain privacy. This unique system not only guarantees security but also enables users to check balances without syncing the entire chain, making balance inquiries both homomorphically encrypted and easily accessible.

Homomorphic encryption permits operations on encrypted data without requiring decryption, preserving data confidentiality. With DERO's encrypted blockchain utilizing this encryption, users can expect top-tier privacy, security, instant transactions, settlement, and easily accessible balance inquiries.

The DERO Homomorphic Encryption Blockchain Protocol (DHEBP) is decentralized, private, and scalable. Wallets within the DERO ecosystem execute a single spending transaction at a time, preventing double spending and allowing subsequent transactions to be promptly settled within the same block for instant confirmation.
