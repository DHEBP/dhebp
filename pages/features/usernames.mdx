## User-friendly Wallet Addresses

Sending and receiving funds in the world of cryptocurrency often involves sharing lengthy wallet addresses. However, with DERO's built-in username feature, you can register a personalized name and associate it with your wallet address on the network. Once registered, your username can be used by others to send funds, Non-fungible Assets (NFAs) and private messages to your wallet.

#### Benefits of Usernames

By registering a name, you not only simplify the process of sending and receiving assets but also enhance security and reduce the risk of errors in transactions. Additionally, a username allows for easier identification and communication within the DERO ecosystem.
#### Registering Your Name

The process is simple. Just choose a name you'd like to associate with your wallet and register it using either the official [Dero CLI Wallet](https://github.com/deroproject/derohe/releases) or the official [Dero GUI Wallet](https://github.com/DEROFDN/Engram/releases). Names can have 6 or more characters in length. They are case sensitive so sending funds to `JaneDoe` is different than sending funds to `janedoe`.
