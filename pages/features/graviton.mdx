At the core of Dero's infrastructure resides Graviton, a purpose-built key-value store database meticulously crafted to meet the intricate demands of DeroHE. Serving as the primary database for Dero, Graviton performs a crucial role in securely managing and storing all account balances in an encrypted state. It exhibits a remarkable similarity to ZFS, a renowned file system celebrated for its integrity and data protection attributes.

Graviton is more than a database; it stands as a robust, feature-rich, and corruption-resistant key-value store database, well-suited for diverse applications and environments. Its innovative design ensures data integrity, facilitating convenient snapshots for backups while enabling live updates without compromising the database's stability. This unique approach ensures Graviton's adaptability and reliability within the ever-evolving ecosystem of DeroHE.

Similar to a bank, Graviton updates balances in an encrypted manner, relying solely on cryptographic proofs to maintain accuracy, ensuring unparalleled privacy and security for account holders. However, what truly sets Graviton apart is its ability to store uncompiled code within its database structure, eliminating the reliance on a centralized code source.

This pioneering feature empowers the entire Dero network by providing resilience against censorship attempts, even in scenarios where entities attempt to shut down the entire internet. Graviton's decentralized nature enables the restoration of the entire Dero network from a single node copy, making it resistant to disruptions or censorship attempts.

Graviton represents an authenticated and append-only key-value store that supports version tracking, snapshots, cryptographic proofs, and efficient diffing mechanisms, addressing significant limitations observed in traditional databases. Its open-source nature, seamless integration into Golang applications, and unwavering commitment to quality code further establish its significance in the database landscape. 
### Append-only data storage system
An append-only data storage system, often employed in blockchain technology, establishes a framework that guarantees data immutability, security, and transparency.

This system operates by enforcing a strict rule where any new data can only be added without modifying or deleting the existing information. This characteristic ensures that once data is recorded, it remains unaltered and becomes effectively immutable. The architecture prevents retroactive changes or deletions to previously stored information, fostering an environment of data integrity and trustworthiness.

The append-only nature of this system plays a pivotal role in maintaining a transparent and tamper-proof record of all transactions or records. By restricting modifications to appending new data, each addition becomes a permanent and verifiable entry in the system's log, contributing to the overall security and auditability of the stored information. This approach offers robust protection against unauthorized alterations or manipulations while upholding a transparent history of events or data changes, bolstering trust and reliability within the system.
### Graviton API
Graviton's minimalistic API, scalability for exabyte-sized data stores, decoupled storage layer, cryptographic proof generation, versatile storage options, and complete code coverage make it a reliable and adaptable database solution suitable for various applications.

Graviton's codebase is available on GitHub (https://github.com/deroproject/graviton)
