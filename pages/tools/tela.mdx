# What is TELA?

TELA is a revolutionary decentralized web standard that enables secure and decentralized storage of application files on the blockchain. TELA empowers developers to create browser-based applications that run locally, eliminating reliance on third-party servers.

## Overview

TELA is built on the [DERO Blockchain](https://dero.io) using smart contracts. It allows developers to deploy decentralized applications (dApps) directly to the blockchain, ensuring:

- **Decentralized Storage**: Applications are stored and executed locally.
- **Data Integrity**: Files are immutable and tamper-proof.
- **User Privacy**: Eliminates third-party server dependencies.

### What Makes TELA Unique?

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Decentralized Storage** | Applications are stored on the blockchain, ensuring data integrity and availability. |
| **Smart Contracts** | Built on DERO's blockchain, TELA uses smart contracts to manage file storage and execution. |
| **Cross-Platform** | Compatible with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSON, and Markdown. |
| **Privacy & Security** | User data remains private, with no third-party interference. |
| **Modular Development** | Reusable code libraries for faster and cleaner development. |


## Use Cases

- **Decentralized Applications**: Build dApps with no centralized servers.  
- **Libraries**: Create reusable code libraries for the TELA ecosystem.  
- **Marketplaces**: Host decentralized marketplaces for digital goods.  
- **Data Sharing**: Securely share files and documents on the blockchain.  

## Core Components

TELA is built around two primary smart contract types:

1. **TELA-INDEX-1**  
   - The entrypoint for TELA applications.  
   - Manages file dependencies and ensures proper execution.  

2. **TELA-DOC-1**  
   - Stores the actual application files (HTML, CSS, JS, etc.).  
   - Supports multiple programming languages and file types.  

### Additional Features

- **File Management**: Version control and updates are handled through mutable and immutable contracts.  
- **Connectivity**: Supports DERO's XSWD protocol for wallet interactions.  
- **Rating System**: Community-driven ratings help users evaluate content quality.  

## Advanced Features

### Content Rating System

TELA includes a community-driven rating system for content. Users can rate applications on a scale of 1-100, with categories like:

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Exceptional | 9 |  
| Very Good | 8 |  
| Good | 7 |  
| Average | 6 |
