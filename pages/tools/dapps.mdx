# What are dApps?
![Decentralized Applications](/assets/dapps.jpeg)

Decentralized Applications (dApps) represent a spectrum of applications leveraging decentralized blockchain technology. They encompass a wide range of services spanning financial tools, artistic initiatives, gaming platforms, and various other applications. These applications operate on decentralized networks, significantly challenging any governing authority's ability to enforce restrictions, control content, or impede usage.

The decentralized nature of dApps ensures a high level of resilience against external interference, censorship, or alteration by any centralized authority. Utilizing blockchain technology, dApps establish a distributed network that operates without a single controlling entity, empowering users with increased autonomy and data ownership.

Within the Dero ecosystem, developers have the advantage of building dApps using the custom [DVM-Basic](/features/dvm) Smart Contract language. This specialized programming language, tailored for the Dero Virtual Machine (DVM), facilitates the creation of decentralized applications. By utilizing DVM-Basic, developers can design and implement a diverse array of decentralized solutions, taking advantage of the inherent security and immutability offered by the Dero blockchain.
